## Final Project  

# HUDM6026_Final_Project

This project is about Data Simulations with a Simple Linear Regression Model. Chenguang Pan (cp3280@tc.columbia.edu) and Sen Lei(sl4846@tc.columbia.edu) made equal contributions. Specifically, Chenguang oversaw the data management, coding, and model building components, while Sen was responsible for code verification and engaging in discussions about the results of the models.  
Please note, OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT(2023) is only used to refine the language in this project.  

Thanks to Prof. Keller for wonderful lectures this semester and to Sen Lei for his dedicated collaboration.
